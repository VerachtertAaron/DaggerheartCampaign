Don't do it in one day! Have some encounters to ramp up to the big stuff.
- Dark forest
- Ambush
- Find one of the missing miners/archaeologists/... guiding them
- A few stray undead?
- Find some fun monsters / locations / environments!
- Long rest at camp before entering the "location"
- Any hints / clues as in to the opening finale? Like some random undeads? Dead people / beasts / creatures? Bloody scene, but no corpses?

MAKE SURE THE BBEG KILLS OR DESTROYS SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO T THE PCs (or at least make it seem like it)

MAKE THE PCS FEEL LIKE THEY ARE POWERLESS FOR THE MOMENT, but make it believable that the BBEG lets them leave and/or just don't notice them and/or has better things to do and/or force them to do stuff they don't want to do (don't make it inherently evil, but make it have an unforeseen evil consequence), maybe the bbeg is somewhere else and sets something in motion? e.g. the graveyard next to an important village or city. BBEG is a necromancer, so maybe he can speak and/or see through the corpse of the npc they were supposed to save!!!

Can I incorporate one or more of the PCs? Anyone important to them missing?

Do they find any fun / random NPCs that gives a side quest?

PCs stumble upon a dormant tomb of the necromancers, fast starting their campaign to conquer with zombies. Necron tomb world! How about, the more they explore, the bigger the "wake up"? WH40k game like

PCs trigger the death energy powering necromancy faction. Potentially the energy gets "piped" to the graveyard of the nearby village, and they get to decipher that it's going to hit either their home village or a nearby big city next?

Shamelessly steal Age of Umbra opening with someone getting infected

PCs rescue someone being used in ritual to quickstart the necromancy guild. If ritual success: necromancy faction starts. If ritual fails: maybe the guy "dies" anyways but rescued by the institute? But then no real kickstart

Either way, prefer necromancy faction to be triggered first as it's the most in your face faction: undead horde threatening the kingdom. This also gives time for the other 2 factions to ramp up with this newly unleashed necromantic energy in the world.
- Death cult sees people rising from the dead, instead of just guarding Death as sacred, they secretly also start killing people to make sure that "the dead stay dead", so also "the living will eventually stay dead"
- The institute manages to capture the necromantic energy to create sentient semi-undead clones, living things that slowly succumb to undeath, while capturing the originial "host" to work as slaves in their consortium. Further down the line they might capture a PC, up to the rest to rescue them while working with their to-be-undead "replacement".
