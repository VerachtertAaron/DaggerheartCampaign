How lethal?
Do you prefer to "already be a team" or to "grow into a team"?
Do you want a more sandboxy environment, where the overarching story bubbles up throughout all the adventures, or an overarching story that blasts through the gates from the start?
How long do you want the campaign? For sure multiple arcs that have stand alone goals and consequences
How much influence do you want to have on the story?

Early questions on the world:
- What is one mystery unsolved in the world
- What is one location you want to visit?
- What is one danger to the world that sounds exciting to you (yet not essential to the plot)?
	- Faction
	- Monster
	- Growing location
	- Roaming danger e.g. storm passing every few months (see Age of Umbra)
