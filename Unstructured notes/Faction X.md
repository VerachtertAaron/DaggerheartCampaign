The institute consists of wizards that are total sociopaths. They just take and kill and experiment without any empathy. Their goal is not to kill, but to advance their magical means

Their synths are half-clanks

3 levels of "life insurance":
1. body transported and burned (3 handfuls of gold) to not go undead
2. body transported, warded and returned to the loved ones (1 bag of gold)
3. body transported, REVIVED and returned to the loved ones (1 chest of gold)

PC will receive either a big discount on option 3, or find an ambushed transport of the amulets with one that will bind to the first one that opens a crate or something
