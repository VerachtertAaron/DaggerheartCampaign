Dramatic irony: seeing something happen that the PCs don't know (but the players do)
Always have something to work towards
Have intermediate goals (luitenants?)
Make the intermediate goals have consequences upon success / failure
Ultimate victory seems impossible at the moment, there needs to be a mystery / ally / powerful artifact / bbeg weak spot to uncover first
Have multiple ways of solving stuff
Don't make a failure be the end, just make it harder
