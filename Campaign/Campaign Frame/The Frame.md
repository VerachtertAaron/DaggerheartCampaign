# Overview
- Hundreds of years ago, the area where we start this story was controlled by The Empire of the Trinity. Nowadays we also know it as the Empire of the Old Gods. It was a theocracy, with the Triumvirate at the wheel: the heads of church of the three gods in the Pantheon. These gods are [[Pantheon#Cynon, God of Death]], [[Pantheon#Eripnes, God of Life]] and [[Pantheon#Praditaea, God of Rebirth]]. All aspects of life were guided by the principles, customs and rules imposed by the Triumvirate, and watched over by the Crusaders of the Pantheon. 
- As the enforcers of the Gods, these crusaders were the police and army of The Empire. The batallions of these Holy Forces were lead by the first sons and daughters of the aristocracy.
- Not much is known about how or why it happened, but at a certain point the leader of the Crusaders,  Athelios, plotted against the Triumvirate, in what is now known as The Great Usurpation. He had each three of the church leaders captured and imprisoned, outlawing all worship of the Old Gods and imposing a new divine leadership, with him at the head as the self proclaimed God-King. He ruled with iron fist, and brought a reign of terror upon the empire. Imperialistic and without remorse, he conquered most of this continent. But his ambitions were never satisfied, and he decided to reach for the heavens. He killed the imprisoned archbishops in a sadistic ritual meant to sever the connection of the Gods with this mortal realm and claim their power as his own. However, his plan was foiled by something he did not anticipate. In a selfless act, Praditaea, the God of Rebirth, sacrificed herself to negate the ritual and protect the other two Gods. Struck by the anger of the remaining Gods, Athelios was killed and sealed away.
- After The Great Usurpation, The Old Gods, now disgusted by mortal life and its lowly ambitions, struck down the Empire. Houses, buildings, areas and even cities were banished from this plane, together with everyone in it at that time. Nothing could get in, nothing could get out. The gods then decided to leave the remaining inhabitants of the continent to the whims of the universe, no longer intervening.
- Over time, most of the empire was forgotten. Most of the people who could read and write were banished, so there was almost no one of the Empire left to record what had been lost. Hints of these old remnants of the empire were recorded in the annals of neighbouring countries and various tribes that escaped the influence of the emperor and his armies, but most are no longer remembered.
- As the Old Pantheon retreated, a void was created soon filled by lesser Gods. **CRAFT THIS TOGETHER**
- Nowadays, this continent is ruled by mostly smaller kingdoms. Learning from the mistakes of their ancestors, most of these kingdoms are no longer ruled by churches. People are still weary to give too much power to the priests and followers of the New Pantheon. **CRAFT THIS KINGDOM TOGETHER**
- In the recent years, seals are weakening, locations are being uncovered. Not all at once, but all over the place and all over time and definitely not in the place they originally disappeared from. Some deep into the forest or out into a mountain range, one rumoured at the bottom of a lake. Some even inside cities and villages, with panic and occasionally even disastrous events to follow. Most of these locations just appear to be abandoned ruins of the Empire of the Old Pantheon, with some locations containing valuable trinkets. The bigger locations, like the cities, have either not appeared or are still left to be uncovered.
- However, not everything trapped inside perished in these years of imprisonment. Magical anomalies, Old constructs and Clanks, and also monsters have been emerging from these unsealed locations. **WHAT RUMOURS HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT EVENTS, LOCATIONS, MONSTERS OR OTHER THREATS? HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE OR TREASURE?**
- We start our story in a relatively small city at the outskirts of the kingdom next to the wilderness. A lot of adventurers pass through here to find their fortune in the mostly unknown lands beyond the borders of the kingdom. City on an island in the middle of a river. 2nd in line voor koning is naar hier gestuurd en leidt de uitbreiding van het koninkrijk naar het bos
- Koninkrijken zijn vanuit de randen van het continent het midden (groot bos) aan het veroveren. Wel competitiviteit tussen koningkrijken, maar geen grote oorlogen enkel schermutselingen.
- Some factions have emerged to uncover the mysteries of these now unsealed locations, but most of these are organising in the major cities which are at the moment far from your party.
- Besides all that, rumors started spreading about a strange traveler bringing people back from the cusp of death, Doctor who style having a different body but all the memories and skills of their old selves. This had lead to the belief that resurrection magic might have reappeared? Is this mysterious figure somehow linked to the old God of Rebirth? Major factions started researching and investigating in a race against time to become the leading institute to control the newfound school of divine magic.

# Communities
- **Highborne & Orderborne:** As part of a society that takes part of kingdoms that distrust any godly worship, where do you stand in this mentality? Does your community hold any special beliefs or rules, and do you hold them as well?
- **Loreborne:** There are some loreborne communities of archaeologists and historians that specialize in the time period before, during and after The Great Usurpation. What does your community focus on? Did you set out with a specific mystery to learn about?
- **Wanderborne:** As part of a wandering community, you might have encountered some of these unsealed locations before. What were they, and what did you learn from them?
# Ancestries
- **Clank:** either related to Old Empire (stone) or science based new world order (metal)
- **Elves:** very old ones might have been alive at the time of the Great Usurpation, however too old to adventure. You might have family that can tell some tales about the Old Empire though.
- **Fungril:** As the tendrils of the fungril networks extend throughout the continent and have done so for eternity, you might have an affinity for finding unsealed or Not-yet-unsealed Locations. Your elders will for sure know some locations that have vanished.
- **Infernis:** very rare, you'd be sure to attract some attention; especially from the Churches of the Old Gods as they see you as ancient enemies that potentially corrupted the God-King and his Crusaders.
# Classes
- Splendor users
	- As the Old Pantheon revoked their direct influence on this world, worshippers are rare. However, some fractions kept on worshipping them and recently, Splendor users have started to turn up with powers linked to the God of Life & God of Death. They are generally viewed as fanatic cultists. Worshippers of the God of Rebirth won't have divine powers. Whatever you choose, you would be a worshipper with potentially newfound powers. No link with the organisational aspect of your church, but you might know some people.
	- Seraphs of the God of Life & Death will be potentially more deeply connected to the story, which might force you to either embrace or revoke your church based on personal beliefs. Both might lead to complications for you and/or your party.
	- Of course also the possibility to worship one of the New Gods.
- Magic users
	- The unsealing of the Reawakened Locations has made people less trusting of magic users, as if it's the collective fault of all magic wielders. Be ready to face some conflicts or consequences.
# Campaign Mechanics
- Resurrection magic has been lost in time. For the moment, it is impossible to find a priest that can bring back your allies.
- Unsealed Locations are hotspots for magical energy. Be prepared to encounter any ongoing magical effects.
> [!Spoiler]- 
> - Extra death insurance after encountering [[The Institute]]:
>	- Bronze level (1 handful / month): body is incinerated
>	- Silver level (1 bag / month): body is warded and returned
> - Extra death move after encountering [[The Institute]]:
>	- Gold level (1 chest / month, **can activate only once**): only roll hope die for risk it all
>	- Platinum level (10 chests / month, **can activate only once**): same as gold, but roll d20
> - After being damaged by undead, scars become infected. Gives the infected a +1 damage per scar, but upon marking all scars you turn undead. Cure unknown
> - After the undeath scourge has been triggered, resting becomes dangerous (see Age of Umbra Lurking Darkness)
## Major Locations
- Capital of the old Empire could house a lot of clues on what happened during and after the Great Usurpation
- Current capital of the kingdom houses plenty of factions and commerce. 

# Session zero questions
- Think of how the unsealing of the locations matters to you. Were you impacted personally? Are you perhaps interested? Interested in the magical aspects, or the archaeological? Curious about who or what was trapped inside when the sealing happened?
- Think of how you view worshippers of the gods, old and new. Do you worship yourself?
- How did you meet the rest of the party?
- Do you belong to a faction?
