# Concept
# Overview
- Hundreds of years ago, this area was controlled by The Empire of the Old Gods, ruled by the Church of the Pantheon. It was a theocratic empire, with the Triumvirate at the wheel. The triumvirate consisted of the heads of church of the three gods in the Pantheon: [[Pantheon#Cynon, God of Death]], [[Pantheon#Eripnes, God of Life]] and [[Pantheon#Praditaea, God of Rebirth]]. All aspects of life were guided by the principles, customs and rules imposed by the Triumvirate, and watched over by the Crusaders of the Pantheon.
- As the enforcers of the Gods, these crusaders were the police and army of The Empire.
- Not much is known about how or why it happened, but at a certain point the leader of the Crusaders, the God-King Athelios plotted against the Triumvirate, in what is now known as The Great Usurpation. He had each three of the church leaders captured and killed in a sadistic ritual meant to sever the link of the Churches with the Gods and claim their power as his own. In a selfless act, Praditaea sacrificed herself to negate the ritual and protect the other two Gods. Struck by the anger of the remaining Gods, Athelios was killed and sealed away.
- After The Great Usurpation, The Old Gods, now disgusted by mortal life and its lowly ambitions, struck down the Empire. Houses, buildings, areas and even cities were sealed, not in a traditional way, but using illusionary magic that hides these areas by bending space. Hints of these old locations were recorded in the annals of neighbouring countries and tribes, but most are no longer remembered, let alone their locations.
- As the Old Pantheon retreated, a void was created soon filled by lesser Gods.
	- **CRAFT THIS TOGETHER**
- Nowadays, this continent is ruled by mostly smaller kingdoms. Learning from the mistakes of their ancestors, most of these kingdoms are no longer ruled by the Church. People are still weary to give to much power to the priests and followers of the New Pantheon. **CRAFT THIS KINGDOM TOGETHER**
- In the recent years, 
	- Seals are weakening, locations are being uncovered. Not all at once, but all over the place and all over time. Bigger stuff usually in uninhabited places deep into the forest or out into a lake, but smaller stuff all accross the continent. Some even inside cities and villages, with panic and occasionally even disastrous events to follow. Most of these locations just appear to be abandoned ruins of the Empire of the Old Pantheon, with some locations containing valuable trinkets. Some factions have emerged to uncover the mysteries of these now unsealed locations, but most of these are organising in the major cities which are far from your party.
	- Somehow, monsters have been appearing near these unsealed locations
		- **CRAFT SOME RUMORS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, OLD POWERS OR FOES THAT HAVE NOW AGAIN BEEN FREED**
	- Rumors started spreading about a traveler bringing people back, Doctor who style #todo this needs a good story with an example.
