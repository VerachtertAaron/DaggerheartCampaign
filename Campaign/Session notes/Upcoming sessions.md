## Scenes
- Party goes off to rescue another adventuring party somewhere. They were tasked with investigating signs of an unsealed location marked on a map, somewhere in the forest nearby. Ask them how they know these adventurers and why they want to go rescue them.
	- Marcus (Warrior)
	- Gabe (Rogue)
	- Emily (Sorcerer)
	- 
- **Tracking in the forest. Quest giver has given them a crude map. Progress counter 8, Consequence counter 5.** Upon Second consequence counter, mark a stress and you get lost for a while.
	- **Knowledge:** Read the map. Upon getting lost, recognizing the way back.
	- **Instinct** Look for tracks of the previous party. Reaction roll to recognize landmark.
	- **Strength** Use a blade to slash yourself a way through the undergrowth as a shortcut
	- **Agility** Reaction roll to not lose your footing on some loose rocks descending a hill. Mark a stress upon failure.
- Encounter in the forest. A tribe of dryads got attacked by the ruffians at the church. Upon ambush, shout "Kill those that killed our sisters!"
	- **Goal**: Stop the dryads from killing the party.
	- **Solutions**: defeat or reason.
	- **Adversaries**: [[Dryad ambush in beginner forest]]
	- **Rewards (only for reason)**: dryads point them in the right direction, giving them advantage on tracking
- Party comes upon ruins of a church, guarded by ruffians
	- They hear some noises, people discussing loudly
	- They see some figures with a pyre burning next to the entrance
	- Ask them how they want to approach? sneakily?
		- **With hope:** Hear the discussion about how they lost some crewmembers, and all this for this shady organization. Should've never accepted. Thank god they got to their fallen comrades first, as falling into the hands of "them" is something you wouldn't wish upon your worst enemy.
		- **With fear:** Ruffians think they hear something, stop their discussion in case their employers approach.
	- If they manage to capture the ruffian leader, plead for his life and not letting his boss know. Death is not the worst punishment.
- Secret church of The Undying
	- Ruins of an old church.
		- Knowledge group roll **DC12** to see if they remember any church on maps of the area.
	- Entrance as open air courtyard.
		- Overgrown with vines and moss.
		- Statue in the middle half crumbled, cannot be recognised as the torso is missing
		- Doors to left, right and center. Left and right lead to what look like old living quarters, including a dining hall, kitchen, small empty rooms. No more furniture, except for the stone remains of the stove and chimney in the kitchen
	- Continuing, main church hall
		- Find acolytes performing ritual on bodies of the fallen party members (to infuse them with undeath). Acolytes run away into secret passage. Later hear the lieutenant curse at the acolytes for showing them the secret passage
	- Secret passage puzzle #todo 
	- Secret passage leads to the crypts, lots of sarcophaguses with mummified, withered, rotten or skeletonized corpses. Most of them contain runes pulsating with power. Players can try to destroy the corpses, if any magic users present make a knowledge roll (DC10) to recognize warning runes. If success with hope, also recognize that these runes are using an old, cruder magic that is very rare these days. The "undead" runes cannot be recognized.
	- After the crypts, main worship room. Here, the lieutenant can be heard scolding the acolytes. You hear them scurrying around to prep the ritual for the body snatching of one of the adventurers. Ritual starts on 10 if approached undetected, on 8 if detected. Each roll with fear ticks down the ritual.
		- Ritual completed: consciousness transferred to adventurer
		- Ritual not completed (someone gets into close range or lieutenant drops to 3 hp): lieutenant tries to escape, closes pathway behind him.
	- Either way, afterwards BBEG gives speech, warns adventurers to stop their investigation and triggers the undead horde.
	- Defeating the undead horde should be possible, but very difficult. Tell them they saw at least 30 bodies with runes upon them, and what sounds like screams of the damned coming this way.
	- If they decide to run, there's a pathway where either the lieutenant ran off to or just visible. Ask the closest one to do a DC8 instinct roll to recognize that this door can probably be opened using some force.
	- Chase scene (8 progress, 12 consequence)
		- **Strength**: open the door, barricade the door from the other side
		- **Instinct** To sense a draft of air
		- **Knowledge** To orientate yourself inside the tunnels, knowing that going left at a fork would lead back to where you came
		- **Finesse** or **Strength** To open the mechanism at the end of the pathway
		- **Agility** to run away and deftly avoid rubble on the ground
