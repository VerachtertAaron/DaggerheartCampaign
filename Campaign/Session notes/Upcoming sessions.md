## Scenes
- Party goes off to rescue another adventuring party somewhere. They were tasked with investigating signs of an unsealed location marked on a map, somewhere in the forest nearby.
	- Marcus (Warrior)
	- Gabe (Rogue)
	- Ellie (Sorcerer)
- #todo Encounter in the forest. Maybe some lowlife looking for treasure?
- Party comes upon ruins of a church, guarded by ruffians
	- They hear some noises, people discussing loudly
	- They see some figures with a pyre burning next to the entrance
	- Ask them how they want to approach? sneakily?
		- **With hope:** Hear the discussion about how they lost some crewmembers, and all this for this shady organization. Should've never accepted. Thank god they got to their fallen comrades first, as falling into the hands of "them" is something you wouldn't wish upon your worst enemy.
		- **With fear:** Ruffians think they hear something, stop their discussion in case their employers approach.
	- If they manage to capture the ruffian leader, plead for his life and not letting his boss know. Death is not the worst punishment.
- Secret church of The Undying
	- Ruins of an old church.
		- Knowledge group roll **DC12** to see if they remember any church on maps of the area.
	- Entrance as open air courtyard.
		- Overgrown with vines and moss.
		- Statue in the middle half crumbled, cannot be recognised as the torso is missing
		- Doors to left, right and center. Left and right lead to what look like old living quarters, including a dining hall, kitchen, small empty rooms. No more furniture, except for the stone remains of the stove and chimney in the kitchen
	- Continuing, main church hall
		- Find acolytes performing ritual on bodies of the fallen party members
